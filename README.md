## üìä Understanding the Simulation

### Day Type Generation
- Random digits (0-99) are generated for each day
- Based on cumulative probabilities, days are classified as Good, Fair, or Poor
- Each day type has different demand characteristics

### Demand Generation
- For each day type, demand is randomly selected from the configured range
- Demands are always multiples of the bundle size
- Random digits are recorded for reproducibility

### Profit Calculation
For each day:
- **Revenue** = min(demand, papers_bought) √ó selling_price
- **Cost** = papers_bought √ó cost_price
- **Salvage** = max(0, papers_bought - demand) √ó scrap_price
- **Lost Profit** = max(0, demand - papers_bought) √ó (selling_price - cost_price)
- **Daily Profit** = Revenue - Cost + Salvage

### Optimization
The system tests various purchase quantities (in bundle size increments) and calculates the expected profit for each quantity based on the simulated demand patterns. The quantity with the highest average daily profit is recommended.

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with realistic probabilities** that sum to 1.0 (automatically normalized)
2. **Set demand ranges** that reflect your market research
3. **Run longer simulations** (500-1000 days) for more stable optimization
4. **Test different scenarios** by adjusting parameters and re-running
5. **Download results** for further analysis in Excel or other tools

## üìà Example Scenario

**Default Configuration:**
- Cost Price: $0.50
- Selling Price: $1.50
- Scrap Price: $0.10
- Bundle Size: 10 newspapers
- Purchase Quantity: 50 newspapers/day
- Good Day (35%): Demand 40-70
- Fair Day (45%): Demand 20-40
- Poor Day (20%): Demand 10-30

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Profit per sold paper: $1.00
- Loss per unsold paper: $0.40 (cost - scrap)
- Opportunity cost: $1.00 per missed sale

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version: `python --version` (must be 3.8+)

### Simulation runs slowly
- Reduce the number of simulation days
- Increase the simulation speed slider to 0

### Charts not updating
- This is normal - charts update every 5 days to improve performance
- They will update at the end of the simulation
